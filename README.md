# Pythonic Practice

A collection of small console apps created to learn Pythonic software development.

## Getting started

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:shektor/python-refresh.git
> cd python-refresh
```

## How to use

Respective apps within each folder can be run from the console by executing program with python.
